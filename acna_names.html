		<h2>What are the most common names of parishes in the Anglican Church in North America?</h2>
    <h3>The Background</h3>
    	<p>Talk about the idea</p>
      <h3>The Data</h3>
      <p>I got the data (which was just names) from here: <a href="https://www.acna.org/admin_units?q%5Bkind_eq%5D=Congregation">acna.org.</a> There were 983 entities on that list, not all of which were churches. I did not carefully check if all were churches, but I did remove one senior center. Thus, I considered 982 churches.</p>

      <img src="images/all_names.png" alt="Pie chart with percentages of ACNA parish names by category." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      <br><p><b>Figure 1.</b> It's clear that I've been reading a lot less fiction (plays and poetry are included) over the years. I don't think that is ideal--a lot of the books that have stuck with me the longest have been fiction.</p>
      <img src="images/saints.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of many saints." width="558"border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 2.</b> I have apparantly been getting harsher in my assessments. The median rating also dropped from 4 stars in 2018-2020 to 3 stars in 2021.</p>
      <img src="images/evangelists.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the four evangelists." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 3. </b>Maybe I'm just spending time with books I don't like as much.</p>
      <img src="images/disciples.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the twelve disciples." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 4. </b>This is interesting. I took a look at whether the principal author was a man or a woman, and found a massive increase in the amount of material written by women I've been reading. In 2018 I read only one book written by a woman (<i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>) and twenty-seven written by men (only ten male authors, however). By 2021 this was up to 30%.</p>
      <img src="images/shepherd.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after Christ as shepherd." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 5.</b> The Dark Ages are real haha. That big spike in books written in the BC period in 2019 was due to an Athenian playwrights kick.</p>
<br><h3>The Genres</h3>
        <img src="images/trinity.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Trinity." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
          <br><p><b>Figure 6. </b>In 2018 (my last full year of high school), I read a ton of fiction, most of which was fantasy and science fiction. The plays were mostly Attic dramatists. My favorite book this year was probably <i>Oathbringer</i>, a fantasy novel.</p>
      <img src="images/cross.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Cross of Christ." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      <br><p><b>Figure 7.</b> I really stepped up the variety of my reading this year. The biggest factor in that was probably starting college (especially for the Philosophy segment). The plays this year were mostly the comedies of Aristophanes. My favorite book this year was <i>Class</i> by Paul Fussell, a satire of the American class system.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>The Future</h3>
      <p>I'd like to read at least 40 books in 2022. I don't want the number to decrease and 40 in 2021 wasn't a huge burden. I would like to get the percent of the books written by women up to >40%. And I would like to read at least these five things from my waiting list.</P>
      <br><p>1. Dramas by Eurpides, at least <i>Medea</i>, <i>Bacchae</i>, and <i>Trojan Women</i></P>
      <br><p>2. <i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</i> by John Donne</P>
      <br><p>3. <i>Silence</i> by Shusaku Endo.</P>
      <br><p>4. <i>The Violent Bear It Away</i> by Flannery O'Conner</P>
      <br><p>5. <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i> by Leo Tolstoy</P>
