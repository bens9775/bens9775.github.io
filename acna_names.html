		<h2>What are the most common names of parishes in the Anglican Church in North America?</h2>
    <h3>The Background</h3>
    		<p>I got the data (which was just names) from here: <a href="https://www.acna.org/admin_units?q%5Bkind_eq%5D=Congregation">acna.org.</a> There were 983 entities on that list, not all of which were churches. I did not carefully check if all were churches, but I did remove one senior center. Thus, I considered 982 churches. I go to a church called All Saints Anglican Church. I have long suspected that "All Saints" is the most common name of ACNA churches. Read on to see if my gut was right.</p>
      <h3>The Data</h3>
      <img src="images/all_names.png" alt="Pie chart with percentages of ACNA parish names by category." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      <br><p><b>Figure 1.</b> This pie chart notes several of the most common categories that ACNA parish churches chose to name themselves after. This is not meant to be comprehensive. Main takeaways: almost one-third of churches are named after one or two specific saints. Almost one-quarter include "Christ" in their name in one of forms (e.g. Christ the King or Christ our Redeemer). The single most common name is "Christ Church" (n=40) and the second most common is "All Saints" (n=37).</p>
      <img src="images/saints.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of many saints." width="558"border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 2.</b> There are a lot of different saints that ANCA churches named themselves after. A .txt file list all instances, including saints with only one church named after them is <a href="saints.txt">here.</a> I was extremely suprised to see so few churches named after the Virgin Mary (I even included Our Lady of X in this category). Maybe no one wants to be thought Catholic?<br>*David here is not King David but St. David of Wales.</p>
      <img src="images/evangelists.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the four evangelists." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 3. </b>John was the disciple Jesus loved, but he is apparantly also the Evangelist Anglicans love.</p>
      <img src="images/disciples.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the twelve disciples." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 4. </b>Poor Judas (not Iscariot) never gets churches named after him because his mom and dad gave him the <a href="http://yeshuaincontext.com/2011/03/jewish-names-in-galilee-and-judea">fourth most common name</a> of his time.</p>
      <img src="images/shepherd.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after Christ as shepherd." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 5.</b> One group of Spanish-speakers prefers "Gran Pastor" and another prefers "Buen Pastor".</p>
      <img src="images/trinity.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Trinity." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 6. </b>Are the 30 ACNA churches that didn't choose "Blessed Trinity" OR "Holy Trinity" <i>real</i> Christians?</p>
      <img src="images/cross.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Cross of Christ." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      	<br><p><b>Figure 7.</b>  I bet King's Cross gets a lot of Harry Potter fans.</p>
