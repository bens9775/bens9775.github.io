		<h2>What are the most common names of parishes in the Anglican Church in North America?</h2>
    <h3>The Background</h3>
    	<p>Talk about the idea</p>
      <h3>The Data</h3>
      <p>I got the data (which was just names) from here: <a href="https://www.acna.org/admin_units?q%5Bkind_eq%5D=Congregation">acna.org.</a> There were 983 entities on that list, not all of which were churches. I did not carefully check if all were churches, but I did remove one senior center. Thus, I considered 982 churches.</p>

      <img src="images/all_names.png" alt="Pie chart with percentages of ACNA parish names by category." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      <br><p><b>Figure 1.</b> This pie chart notes several of the most common categories that ACNA parish churches chose to name themselves after. This is not meant to be comprehensive. Main takeaways: almost one-third of churches are named after one or two specific saints. Almost one-quarter include "Christ" in their name in one of forms (e.g. Christ the King or Christ our Redeemer).</p>
      <img src="images/saints.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of many saints." width="558"border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 2.</b> There are a lot of different saints that ANCA churches named themselves after. A .txt file list all instances, including saints with only one church named after them is <a href="saints.txt">here.</a></p>
      <img src="images/evangelists.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the four evangelists." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 3. </b>John was the disciple Jesus loved, but he is apparantly also the Evangelist Anglicans love.</p>
      <img src="images/disciples.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the twelve disciples." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 4. </b>Poor Judas (not Iscariot) never gets churches named after him because his mom and dad gave him the <a href="http://yeshuaincontext.com/2011/03/jewish-names-in-galilee-and-judea">fourth most common name</a> of his time.<br>*David here is not King David but St. David of Wales.</p>
      <img src="images/shepherd.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after Christ as shepherd." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 5.</b> One group of Spanish-speakers prefers "Gran Pastor" and another prefers "Buen Pastor".</p>
      <img src="images/trinity.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Trinity." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 6. </b>Do the 30 ACNA churches that didn't choose "Blessed Trinity" OR "Holy Trinity" <i>real</i> Christians?</p>
      <img src="images/cross.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Cross of Christ." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      	<br><p><b>Figure 7.</b> I really stepped up the variety of my reading this year. The biggest factor in that was probably starting college (especially for the Philosophy segment). The plays this year were mostly the comedies of Aristophanes. My favorite book this year was <i>Class</i> by Paul Fussell, a satire of the American class system.</p>
