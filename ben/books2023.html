		<h2>Books Analysis: 2023 Update</h2>
    <h3>Some Background</h3>
    <p>Since 2018 I have kept track of the books I've read. Last year I analyzed what I had read through 2022 and this page updates that analysis with 2023 data.</p>
    <p>I will mostly focus on the changes, but previous years are still up. <a href="books.html">2021, </a><a href="books2022.html">2022.</a></p>


		<h3>Last Year's Goals</h3>
						<p>In January 2023 I set several goals for my reading in the then-new year. Read 40 books (I didn't hit this in 2022), read women's books at 45% or greater level, read two books from each of seven time periods, and get through half of a list of 10 books that I've wanted to read for a while. Some of these I succeeded at and others were miserable failures.</p>
						<p><b>Goal 1:</b> Achieved! In fact, I read more books this year than in any since I started keeping track. This is after not reaching my goal last year. (Don't give these numbers too much weight as the length variance is large.)</p>
						<table class="myTable">
						<tr>
						<th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th><th>2022</th><th>2023</th><th>Total</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
						<td>26</td> <td>36</td> <td>29</td> <td>40</td>  <td>38</td>   <td><b>48</b></td> <td>217</td>
						</tr>
						</table>
						<br><p><b>Goal 2:</b> Another success! I started thinking about this about three years ago, and you can see the progress. It looks like a sigmoid curve to me, which is perhaps what one might expect when moving from one stable level to another. More data is needed. </p>
							<img src="images/women_2023.png" alt="Chart showing increase in percent of principal authors who are women." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
							<br><p><b>Goal 3:</b> Miserable failure. Only from the 20th and 21st centuries did I read at least 2 books. As you can see, recent books are more dominant in my reading than ever before. This goal is in conflict with goal 2, but I did have a list of old books I wanted to read, which I just failed to reference much. I'm disappointed with myself here, as I want to be the sort of person who reads lots of classic books.</p>
								<img src="images/era_2023.png" alt="Complex chart showing the periods when the books were written by year.." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
								<p>Another statistic that has been creeping down as my 21st century book % has risen is the fiction %. I was intentionally trying to increase this in 2022, and it worked. When I stopped focusing on it in 2023, I shifted back to nonfiction once again. I'm not sure I care enough about this to work on it. In childhood I mostly read fiction and it is perhaps not suprising that this has changed as I age.</p>

								<br><p><b>Goal 4:</b> I only read 3/10 and the goal was 5/10. So a failure, but better than last year. The ones in bold have been read. I won't set a goal like this for 2024, as it has never worked well in the past.</p>
								<p>1. <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> by Alan Paton</P>
									<b><p>2. <i>Tehanu</i> by Ursula K. Le Guin</P></b>
									<p>3. <i>Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center</i> by bell hooks</P>
									<p>4. <i>Idylls of the King</i> by Tennyson</P>
								<b><p>5. <i>The Civil War as a Theological Crisis</i> by Mark Noll</P></b>
									<b><p>6. <i>The Country of the Pointed Firs</i> by Sarah Orne Jewett</P></b>
									<p>7. <i>Revelations of Divine Love</i> by Julian of Norwich</P>
									<p>8. <i>Analects</i> by Confucius</P>
									<p>9. <i>Middlemarch</i> by George Eliot</P>
									<p>10. <i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</i> by John Donne</P>

		  <h3>Other Findings</h3>

        <img src="images/rating_2023.png" alt="Chart showing decrease in mean star rating over the years." width="558"border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p>Last year I noticed and commented on a stark decline in my mean star rating. Having that finding in my head evidently influenced my 2022 ratings. Rating may or may not be interesting going forward.</p>
      <img src="images/stars_2023.png" alt="Chart showing decrease in percent given 5 star ratings." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p>Same story as mean rating. This suggests I read a lot more books I loved in 2022 than in any year since 2018 and *checks list* that's plausible.</p>

          <img src="images/2023genres.png" alt="Pie chart of genres read in 2023" width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      <br><p>This year's fiction revival was heavily driven by novels. Nonfiction in general took a hit as I already mentioned, with physical science books completely disappearing. To see the genre breakdowns from previous years please consult <a href="books.html">last year's analysis.</a> My favorite book this year was the first one I read--<i>The Supper of the Lamb</i> (1969) by Fr. Robert Farrar Capon. It's a wide-ranging exploration of everything near the intersection of food and theology.</p>
			<br>
      <h3>2023 Goals</h3>
      <p>Even though I'm planning to get married and start medical school in 2023, I'm going to set a goal of 40 books again. I would like to cut down on my screen time and spending time reading books I want to read will help. I'd like to get the percentage of books written by women up to >45%. I'd like to read at least two books from each time period on the chart above.</p>
			<p>Let's try something new with a list of books I want to read. Here's a list of ten books from my reading list. My goal is to read five in 2023.</p>

			<p>1. <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> by Alan Paton</P>
				<p>2. <i>Tehanu</i> by Ursula K. Le Guin</P>
				<p>3. <i>Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center</i> by bell hooks</P>

				<p>5. <i>The Civil War as a Theological Crisis</i> by Mark Noll</P>
				<p>6. <i>The Country of the Pointed Firs</i> by Sarah Orne Jewett</P>
				<p>7. <i>Revelations of Divine Love</i> by Julian of Norwich</P>
				<p>8. <i>Analects</i> by Confucius</P>
				<p>9. <i>Middlemarch</i> by George Eliot</P>
				<p>10. <i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</i> by John Donne</P>
