		<h2>What are the most common names of parishes in the Anglican Church in North America?</h2>
    <h3>The Background</h3>
			<p>I go to a church called All Saints Anglican Church. I have long suspected that "All Saints" is the most common name of ACNA churches. Read on to see if my suspicion was correct.</p>
    	<br>
				<p>I got the data (which was just names) from here: <a href="https://www.acna.org/admin_units?q%5Bkind_eq%5D=Congregation">acna.org.</a> There were 983 entities on that list, <i>almost</i> all of which are churches. I did not carefully check if all were churches, but I did remove two that were clearly not churches. Thus, I considered 981 entities.</p>
      <h3>The Data</h3>
      <img src="images/all_names.png" alt="Pie chart with percentages of ACNA parish names by category." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      <br><p><b>Figure 1.</b> I coded each church with a key word or phrase. This pie chart breaks all the churches up into categories by key word. This is not meant to be comprehensive: "Other" includes all key words with fewer than 25 instances. Main takeaways: almost one-third of churches are named after a saint (or sometimes two, like St. Peter and St. Paul). Almost one-quarter named their church "Christ" in one of many forms (e.g. Christ the King or Christ Our Redeemer).<br>The single most common name is "Christ Church" (n=40) and the second most common is "All Saints" (n=37).</p>
      <img src="images/saints.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of many saints." width="558"border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 2.</b> ACNA churches have named themselves after a lot of different saints, but the distribution is by no means even. A .txt file listing all instances including saints with only one church named after them is available <a href="documents/saints.txt">here.</a> I was extremely suprised to see so few churches named after the Virgin Mary (n=8, even including "Our Lady of X"-type names). Maybe it sounds too Catholic for North American Protestants? Also, the Feast of Saint Joseph (of Nazareth) is the only <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/~ss/commonworship/calendar/holydays.html">Red-Letter Day</a> commemorating a saint which no ACNA parish has as its patron saint.<br>*David here is not King David but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_David">St. David of Wales.</a></p>
      <img src="images/evangelists.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the four evangelists." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 3. </b>John was the disciple Jesus loved, but he is apparantly also the Evangelist Anglicans love.<br>*To be fair, this category includes churches named after both John the Apostle and John the Baptist but this data set has no way of seperating them.</p>
      <img src="images/disciples.png" alt="Number of parishes named after each of the twelve disciples." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 4. </b>Poor Judas (not Iscariot) never gets churches named after him because his mom and dad gave him the <a href="http://yeshuaincontext.com/2011/03/jewish-names-in-galilee-and-judea">fourth most common name</a> of his time. Unless of course all those St. Jude's are named after the disciple, or even if the 2+ men named Ἰουδας are the same person...<br>*note that there are multiple people named James in the NT, but churches do not identify who they are named for. (Same with John).</p>
      <img src="images/shepherd.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after Christ as shepherd." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 5.</b> One group of Spanish-speakers prefers "Gran Pastor" and another prefers "Buen Pastor". By the way, for this analyis Spanish names were usually translated into English for categorization. E.g. “Iglesia Piedra Angular” → "Cornerstone Church" and “Iglesia Santa Cruz” → "Holy Cross Church".</p>
      <img src="images/trinity.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Trinity." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
        <br><p><b>Figure 6. </b>Are the 30 ACNA churches that didn't choose "Blessed Trinity" OR "Holy Trinity" <i>real</i> Christians?</p>
      <img src="images/cross.png" alt="Divisions among the churches named after the Cross of Christ." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
      	<br><p><b>Figure 7.</b>  I bet King's Cross gets a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211006084454/https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/King%27s_Cross_Station">Harry Potter fans.</a></p>
