		<h2>Where will the next cocaine bear arise?</h2>
    <h3>The Original</h3>
		<p>In 2023 a movie called <i>Cocaine Bear</i> was released, a liberties-taking dramatization of a 1985 incident in which an American black bear consumed roughly 75 pounds of cocaine and quickly died. The cocaine had been dropped from an overloaded Cessna flying over the Chattahoochee National Forest in northern Georgia.</p>
		<p>The bear was found a few months later and stuffed. It ended up in a Kentucky mall.</p>

		<p>As far as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230315093019/https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/2/22/23601729/cocaine-bear-movie-true-story">this ursinologist</a> knows, no other bear has every been observed to get hooked on blow. Of couse, this could change eventually. I'm interested in the where. Which state in the Union is the most likely to host the next cocaine bear?</p>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>The way I see it, the question concerns the likelihood of a wild bear coming into contact with <i>any</i> cocaine. To experience a high that isn't instantly fatal
			would only require an amount of cocaine on the order of what human users consume. Kilos and kilos would just be overkill. Note that I'm only looking at wild bears. If a zoo bear
			was given some snow it would be more of a Harambe incident.</p>
			<p>First I needed to get numbers for the amount of cocaine in each state. I expected the DEA or somebody at least to publish estimates, but I found zilch. So I settled on multiplying the percent of the population that used cocaine in 2019 from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/806271/past-year-cocaine-use-us-adults/">here</a> by the state's population to get the
				number of cocaine users per state. Assuming a uniform average of 42 grams/year/user consumed (I got this from a UN factsheet but lost the link), we can divide by land area and get this map of cocaine consumption density.</p>
