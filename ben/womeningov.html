		<h2>These Important Offices Have Never Been Held by a Woman</h2>

		<p>American women have made significant progress towards parity in government positions over the last few decades. Women made up 28% of both the 118th and 119th Congresses and 24% of state governors (as of January 2024). While these numbers are nowhere near 50%, they are big increases over even a few years ago.</p>
<p>Even though a large minority of important government positions are currently held by women, too many have never been held by a woman. This webpage is a list of such elected or appointed civilian offices at the federal, state, or local level. It will be occasionally be updated as women are elected or appointed to these roles for the first time.</p>

<h2>Which states are the worst offenders? (as of mid-2024)</h2>
<p>This is a terrible metric, but there are five lists of states above. Those that have never had a woman as: Senator, Gov., Lt. Gov., Speaker, and Chief Justice. No states are on all five or even four of those lists, but several are on three: Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Texas. Make of that what you will.</p>
