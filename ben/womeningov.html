		<h1>Women (Not) in Government</h1>

		<p>American women have made significant progress towards parity in government positions over the last few decades. Women make up 28% of the 118th Congress and 24% of state governors (as of January 2024). While these numbers are nowhere near 50%, they are big improvements over even a few years ago.</p>

This webpage is a list of those important elected or appointed civilian government positions, at the federal, state, or local level. It will be occasionally be updated as women are elected or appointed to these roles for the first time.</p>
