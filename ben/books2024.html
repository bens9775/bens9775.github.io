		<h2>On My 2024 Reading</h2>

    <p>Since 2018, I've recorded all the books I've read. (I really wish I had started sooner, btw. If you are a reader and you don't keep track of what books you read, I recommend starting.) 2024 did not see me read a record number of books, but I did read books from more different countries than ever before.</p>
    <p>This page updates my analysis of this history with 2024's reading. If you want to see the analyses I posted after previous years, they're still up. Here are <a href="books.html">2021, </a><a href="books2022.html">2022, </a> and </a><a href="books2023.html">2023.</a></p>


		<h3>Last Year's Goals</h3>
						<p>First, let's look back at the goals I set for my 2024 reading at the beginning of last year.<p>


							<b>1: Read 40 books.</b>
							<br>Close, but no cigar. In 2023, I read 48 books and figured a goal of 40 would be reasonable for 2024, even though it would be my first full year of medical school. In truth, the goal was reasonable, but my priorities were not straight—or my loves were not rightly ordered. I only read 38 books. If I had spent less time playing Zelda games or engaging in other screen-related activities I could have fit in far more than two additional books.</p>
						<table class="myTable">
						<tr>
						<th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th><th>2022</th><th>2023</th><th>2024</th><th>Total</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
						<td>26</td> <td>36</td> <td>29</td> <td>40</td>  <td>38</td>   <td>48</td> <td><b>38</b></td><td>255</td>
						</tr>
						</table>


						<br><p><b>2: Ensure at least 45% of books read were by women.</b>
							<br>A success. Half of my 2024 books were by women. Squinting at this graph, you can see a sigmoid curve flattening out around 50%. That was the plan when I started being more thoughtful about my reading around 2021.</p>
							<img src="images/women_2024.png" alt="Chart showing increase in percent of principal authors who are women." width="558" border="0" align="middle">


							<br><p><b>3: Read a decent number of old books from diverse times.</b>
								<br>Miserable failure. Only from the 20th and 21st centuries did I read at least 2 books. Just as happened in 2021 and 2022, I couldn't bring myself to start and finish more than a handful of pre-1900 works. This goal is undeniably in conflict with goal 2 (more female authors) and goal 4 (more books from around the world). It's hard to diverge from my default reading behavior pattern in more than one direction at once.</p>

<!--
								<br><p><b>Goal 4:</b> I only read 3/10 and the goal was 5/10. So a failure, but better than last year. The ones in bold have been read. I won't set a goal like this for 2024, as it has never worked well in the past.</p>
								<p>1. <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> by Alan Paton</P>
									<b><p>2. <i>Tehanu</i> by Ursula K. Le Guin</P></b>
									<p>3. <i>Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center</i> by bell hooks</P>
									<p>4. <i>Idylls of the King</i> by Tennyson</P>
								<b><p>5. <i>The Civil War as a Theological Crisis</i> by Mark Noll</P></b>
									<b><p>6. <i>The Country of the Pointed Firs</i> by Sarah Orne Jewett</P></b>
									<p>7. <i>Revelations of Divine Love</i> by Julian of Norwich</P>
									<p>8. <i>Analects</i> by Confucius</P>
									<p>9. <i>Middlemarch</i> by George Eliot</P>
									<p>10. <i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</i> by John Donne</P>
-->
<br><p><b>4: Read two books from each world cultural region.</b>
	<br>Success for some of the regions: Continental Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. I only read one book from Latin American and zero from MENA.</p>

			<h3>Top Books of the Past Year</h3>
				<p>3. <i>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i> by Julian Jaynes. This 1976 book explores the nature and recent evolutionary history of consciousness. It's a speculative book by necessity and argues a radical thesis. Dr. Jaynes argues that introspection and self-awareness (what he calls consciousness) arose in humans after the beginning of language, not long before. It's the sort of book that changes everything if it's true...but it's thesis can't be proven. I only recommend it to people who are willing to read a long book about psychology and archaeology written in the more dense style 20th century academics used in their popular works.</p>
					<p>2. <i>Lavinia</i> by Ursula K. Le Guin. This book is a feminist retelling of part of the <i>Aeneid</i> from the persepective of Aeneas's second wife Lavinia, to whom Virgil gave no lines. Le Guin was a master of speculative fiction and I enjoyed seeing her turn her talents to a pseudo-historical period.</P>
					<p>1. <i>Fictions</i> by Jorge Luis Borges. I recommend this collection of short stories to anyone with an interest in magical realism, infinity, metafiction, surrealism, or philosophical literature. Borges's works are by turns thought-provoking and troubling, but each left me shaking my head at the twisted creativity of his mind. You've probably been exposed to some of his concepts before, perhaps the Library of Babel. I encourage you to pick up any collection of his translated stories.</P>


									<br>
		  <h3>Other Findings</h3>
<p>The next two charts, rating and fiction percentage, seem to be trending together. I wonder if I systematically rate fiction higher than nonfiction? I will address that next year.</p>
        <img src="images/rating_2024.png" alt="Chart showing decrease in mean star rating over the years." width="558"border="0" align="middle">


				<p>The share of my reading that's fiction has hovered around half for several years now. I'm satisfied with that level.</p>
					<img src="images/fiction_2024.png" alt="Chart showing the percentage of all the books I read each year that are fiction." width="558" border="0" align="middle">


      <br>
			<p>Here is a more detailed breakdown than just fiction vs. non-fiction. Due to rounding, 3% is one book and 5% is two. I don't break out novels by genre because 1) categorizing them is difficult and subjective; and 2) I've got to have my secrets. However, if you glance at the table below this chart you may have a good guess as to the top fiction genre of 2024.</p>

				<br><p>Here are my top authors from each year since 2018 with the number and type of books or plays I read from them that year</p>
				<table class="myTable">
				<tr>
				<th>Year</th><th>Author</th><th>Number</th><th>Type</th>

				<tr>
				<td>2018</td><td>Terry Prachett</td><td>11</td><td>Satirical fantasy novels</td>

				<tr>
				<td>2024</td><td>Ursula K. Le. Guin</td><td>4</td><td>Fantasy & sci-fi novels or short stories</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
<br>

      <h3>2025 Goals</h3>
      <p>1) Read 40 books. My failure in 2024 isn't going to stop me in 2025. 2) Read two books from each region on the map above. 3) At least 45% female authors. 4) [NEW] Give at least one book a one-star rating.</p>
			<p>Over the last seven years, I've read but a single book that I gave a one-star review and it was required reading from my least favorite professor in undergrad. These days, if I think a book is trash or, more charitably, just terribly boring, I don't finish it. In 2025, I plan to finish at least one book that I can honestly rate just one star. (My wife gave me this idea.)</p>
