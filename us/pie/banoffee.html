			<p>Words like banoffee stick in your brain, like how gum sticks to your hair or spinach to your teeth. At least, that’s how words feel in my head. I think about them a lot for very short bursts of time and struggle to get them out. Unfortunately, Ben has not had the pleasure of having been infected by the banoffee earworm, so when I suggested making a banoffee pie this Saturday he was unsure how to respond. Seeing as we already had some bananas on hand, I successfully convinced him that this would be the pie for the week.</p>

			<p>I prepared the graham cracker crust by demolishing the crackers with a pastry cutter, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Even though the recipe did not call for anything other than crackers and butter, I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I love not following recipes. It makes me feel like a non-conformist who doesn’t need people to tell me how to think. I am a true chef. As a true chef, I should have known that digestive biscuits and graham crackers do not have the same consistency. I should have trusted my gut! But no, like a sheep I chose to only add 100 grams of melted butter, leaving the crust crumbly and unstable. Alas, a lesson learned.</p>

			<p>The typical banoffee pie calls for dulce de leche, a delicious caramel sauce made by boiling a can of sweetened condensed milk for several hours. We didn't have several hours, so we took a shortcut and quickly boiled brown sugar and butter with the sweetened condensed milk. This likely didn't affect the taste for banoffee pie casuals like ourselves. Plus, it was easy. Sometimes easy is extra delicious because it means you add more sugar and move on. Atop this thick layer of gooey goodness, we placed a single layer of sliced bananas, which were then immediately hidden by homemade whipped cream. I adore whipped cream, and think this pie could have used more, but Ben was content. He adorned it with cocoa powder to counteract the sickening sweetness of the filling, and then we placed it in the fridge to chill until dinner.</p>

			<p>Once Ben was finished cooking dinner (he tried a new recipe for eggplant and tomato pasta, yum!), we sliced the pie and ate it as we ate dinner. Each flavor layer of the banoffee pie complimented those around it. First, your tongue would be greeted by the bitter chocolate of the cocoa powder, then soothed by the light fluffiness of the whipped cream. The banana flavor came next and was toothsome but not overbearing. Then BAM! Sweetened-condensed-milk-sucker-punch! It was chewy and sweet and completely removed any memory of the previous ingredients. Though I appreciated the combination of these flavors, I did not like how little they mixed. Pumpkin pie is a rich blend of ingredients with no layers in the filling. The flavors compliment each other! With the banoffee pie, the ingredients might be rich but the blend isn’t. Nonetheless, it was still tasty.</p>

			<p>Our new housemate, Shadow, was not allowed any pie because we are selfish and do not like sharing. (Just kidding, he actually didn’t even ask. He doesn’t like our cooking.)</p>

			<p>In other news, I think England won second place in the women’s World Cup, and since this pie originated in England, I guess this is in honour of their feat.</p>
