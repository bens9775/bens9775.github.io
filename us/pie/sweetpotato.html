			<p>On Tuesday, June 27th, Katie Beth and I heard a tree fall on our apartment building, moved half our belongings to a storage unit, and signed to vacate our unit in five days. Also, we made a sweet potato pie.</p>
			<p>At 7 AM, we awoke to the sound of a tree from the wooded lot behind the building crashing through the roof of the unit above. After scrambling outside to assess the stability of the tree, we were told to start packing up to move into another unit of the apartment complex, since the roof was no longer going to stop rain from flooding our bedroom. Instead, we asked and received approval to vacate our apartment and end our year-long lease.</p>

			<p>“Hold your horses! Back up! Why would you want to end your lease rather than move to another unit?” you might be saying at this point, and for good reason, considering how few people are actively hoping for a tiny natural disaster to occur to them on any given weekday. The answer lies in my recent and unexpected admission into the University of Missouri’s medical school, a school located over 300 miles from our apartment.</p>
			<p>The day before the tree fell, we had been discussing how we would get out of our lease as cheaply and honestly as possible, with ideas ranging from finding a replacement tenant to a miniature fire or flood that only damaged our unit. As it happened, God had the latter in mind. We needed to move our belongings out of the section of the apartment threatened by rain, but we had also agreed to visit a family from church for dinner and bring a pie with us. We managed to do both, though it did cut the time close.</p>
			<p>The chosen recipe begins with boiling a single large sweet potato until tender. In my case, this was over an hour. The potato was peeled, mashed, and blended with eggs, butter, and spices. The hand mixer did not fully eliminate chunks of the vegetable, which was pleasing. In my experience, all the best sweet potato pies have small chunks. The filling was most similar to pumpkin pie, but I added fewer spices yet the end result was much more flavorful and naturally sweet. It was even easier to make than a pumpkin pie as well, with no sweetened condensed milk.</p>

			<p>The crust was made with a 50/50 mixture of shortening and butter. I think it turned out very well, and though the recipe called for a raw crust (not blind-baked), there wasn’t any filling leakage. Everyone who tried this pie pronounced it delicious. The biggest complaint was the shortness of the pie. Before baking, I could tell that there was not a lot of filling. Overall, a great start to our Pie-A-Week project.</p>
