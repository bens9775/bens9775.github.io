			<p>It’s been a busy week for Katie Beth and me. This has been the first full week of her new job and my medical school started officially on Monday. We also got the keys to our new apartment today. Due to the time spent on the adjustment, we decided to make a straightforward pie today.</p>
			<p>The fat in this press-in crust is mostly butter with a bit of cream cheese mixed in. In my opinion, it was actually more difficult to make than a normal roll-out crust, since I can do that well and pretty quickly. Pressing the crust in was pretty time-consuming, though definitely something a child could do (if anyone wants to try that).</p>
			<p>Making the filling was simple--just dump’n’stir. There was a bit of a snag, however, when Katie Beth put in 1 tbsp salt instead of ¼ tsp (a 12x dose). She washed that batch of chess pie filling down the drain and made another. A pie that salty would not have been particularly toothsome.</p>
			<p>Pouring the filling into the cooled crust and baking in a 375 F oven was also pretty easy compared to the baking process of some of the other pies we have made.</p>
			<p>Please with having spared ourselves from baking roughly half the ideal daily sodium intake into each slice, we let the pie cool for a generous length of time before slicing and enjoying.</p>
