			<p>Cake is the dominant birthday dessert in the US for good reason. The icing can easily be turned into a vehicle to convey any cheery message or illustrate any children’s cartoon. When aesthetics are valued over flavor, the cake comes out on top.</P>
				<p><a href='https://www.newspapers.com/article/richmond-times-dispatch-grasshopper-pie/61145330/'>As Dorothy Robertson said in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on March 27, 1960</a>, “Pie, the Great American Dessert, has had more strange names, and sometimes stranger ingredients, than almost anything in the cook’s roster of desserts.”</p>
			<P>The world of pie is weird and wonderful, with options for everything. In my humble opinion, birthday pie should focus less on decoration and more on a flavor especially desired by the subject of the occasion. It was with these thoughts in mind that I prepared a Grasshopper Pie for my mom’s birthday last week. It is one of her favorite desserts.</P>

					<p>To quote Robertson again, “This pie has no grasshoppers in it, just delicious taste.” The pie is named after a mint-flavored mixed drink, which was named for its strong green tint. To make the chocolate crust, I pulverized 22 Oreos in a blender (creme and cookie) and mixed in a half-stick of melted butter before pressing the mixture into a pie pan and freezing.</P>

						<p>To prepare the filling, I combined two creamy mixtures. The first was green-dyed, confectioner’s-sugared, and mint-flavored cream cheese.</P>

							<p>The second was a simple batch of whipped cream. I folded the two together and added a bit more green food coloring to deepen that grassy hue.</P>

								<p>After spooning the filling into the frozen chocolate crust, I shaved some baking chocolate on top and froze the entire pie.</P>

								<p>Katie Beth and I went with my brothers and parents to dinner, and then to look at Christmas lights around Columbia--a real family tradition. When we had seen enough we returned to our apartment to slice and eat the pie.</P>
		<img src="images/Grasshopper-mom.jpg" alt="text" align="middle">
									<p>Unsurprisingly (since she requested it), my mom did like the pie a lot, but so did everyone else! It’s certainly a good pie and I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who like mint chocolate chip ice cream.</P>
