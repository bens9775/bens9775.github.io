			<p>I (Ben) have been feeling a bit stretched for pie ideas these last two weeks. The only one that really seems right is a pumpkin pie, and I’m saving that for Thanksgiving time. The grapefruit pie was a spur-of-the-moment idea. If you have any unusual but delish recipes I would be happy for you to send them our way via email or the comment section.</p>
			<p>Under these circumstances, it can be nice to have constraints. This pie was made with the intention of sharing it with friends, one of whom is gluten-free. I had wanted to make a traditional pastry crust with GF flour for a while, so I latched on to that idea. Additionally, the gluten-eating friend asked for a chilled chocolate pie (or fruit or peanut butter). Since we made a chilled chocolate pie already and 9 of 16 pies so far have been fruit, peanut butter with a chocolate pastry crust stood out as a keen idea.</p>

			<p>I began the crust with a recipe designed for GF flour, hoping this would help sidestep the texture and stability issues that often come up in such concoctions. I think it would have worked except for the wild card: 30-something grams of astringent cocoa powder which I threw in to make a chocolate dough. Rolling out the dough was easy compared with other, more elastic glutinous recipes. On the other hand, the crust did not have structural integrity and developed a rash of holes when I transferred it into the pie dish. I had to seal those up before blind-baking the pie. (Notice how fudgy it looks after baking? I don’t have a good explanation for that.)</p>

			<p>While the crust was in the oven I whipped up some heavy cream and then mixed in creamy peanut butter and cream cheese. (A prize is available to the first person to guess the texture of this filling). I spooned the filling into the cooled crust then whipped up some more heavy cream for the top.</p>

			<p>Looking to add some decorative flair, I put ¼ cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave until the mixture started smoking like a chimney. I took the burnt chocolate outside until the smoke cleared and, with chagrin, asked my wife why it didn’t become pourable. Katie Beth suggested I add a pat of butter (to new chips) and stir often, stopping when they fully melted. I followed her advice and piped the choc over the pie with a plastic baggie.</p>

			<p>One friend labeled the pie “bussin’”, which I consider high praise given the nature of the crust. I recommend the filling recipe highly, paired with as much of that blessed wheaty protein as you and your family can handle.</p>
