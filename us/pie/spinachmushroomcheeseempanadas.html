			<p>At ALDI the other day I noticed a great deal on some brown mushrooms and bought half a pound with no clear plan for cooking them. Searching for recipes online I found one for intriguing baked mini empanadas.</p>

			<p>The buttery crust recipe included egg, making it both tastier and riskier than standard pie crust to eat raw and probably more suitable for making little packets.</p>

			<p>I thinly sliced the fungi and sautéed them with diced onions. Mushrooms really soak up a lot of moisture! Not nearly as easy to cook as most vegetables, in my opinion. I wilted some spinach in the pan after the onions were soft.</p>

			<p>Each empanada was constructed from a rough circle of crust dough, a scant spoonful of savory filling, and a few shreds of cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top. I stuck the edges of the packet together with a bit of egg wash, but it wasn’t really enough for those that suffered from my struggle not to add too much filling. I also brushed egg wash on the tops of the empanadas before baking them at 350 F for about half an hour.</p>

			<p>While they were in the oven I made pork tacos to complete the dinner’s theme. The tacos were pretty delicious, while the empanadas were unfortunately not top-tier in taste. They looked nice and the crust was tasty, but the filling just didn’t hit right. Maybe it needed more spices.</p>

			<p>Be that as it may, we did enjoy munching them for lunches and dinners during the remainder the of the week.</p>
