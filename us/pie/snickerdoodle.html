			<p>Recipe from <i>50 Pies, 50 States</i> by Stacey Mei Yan Fong, p. 75</p>

<p>According to Stacey Fong, the state pie of Connecticut is snickerdoodle. As far as I can tell, she declared this unilaterally and with no legal authority. The claimed basis for her pronouncement is the cultural status of the snickerdoodle cookie in that state. Now, snickerdoodles--and nutmeg in general--are indeed popular in the Constitution State.</p>
<p>A full text search of the CT state laws archive returned no hits for “snickerdoodle”. I did find several online articles discussing bills, presented in multiple years, to name either the snickerdoodle or the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie as the official “state cookie”. No news articles I could find discussed a state cookie bill actually passing. Wikipedia doesn't list any state cookie, pie, or dessert for Connecticut. (Unlike Missouri, which has actually had a legal state dessert since 1904: <a href='idfa.org/the-history-of-the-ice-cream-cone'>the ice cream cone</a>!)</p>


<p>I hope the preceding paragraph hasn't led you astray. This pie isn't just a cookie in a nutmeg-sprinkled crust. It's a legitimate pie, which shares with the cookie an ingredient list: flour, sugar, butter, eggs, baking soda, cream of tartar, cinnamon, and <b>nutmeg</b>. However, the pie filling was much wetter than cookie dough and could easily be spread around the pie crust (which was a pretty typical unbaked single crust).</p>

<p>While snickerdoodle dough balls are rolled in cinnamon sugar, this pie filling was covered with a spiced hot syrup before baking.</p>

<p>As the pie baked, the syrup soaked into the filling and formed a cracked crust reminiscent of the typical cookie appearance. </p>
<p>We served the pie to players of a D&D game. All enjoyed the pie, but the game itself was disastrous--3 out of 5 player characters died.</p>

<p>Like most of the best things in life, the legal status of a pie is immaterial to its quality. </p>
