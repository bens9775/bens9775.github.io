			<p>Uh oh, did we miss a week? No, I have just been grappling with the disappointment of an unyummy pie and it took me four days to generate the strength to write. I clearly cope with disappointment through avoidance. The red flags for this pie were visible from miles away, but sometimes, we must try new things and fail to grow.</p>

			<P>Ben and I have been settling into a church community in Columbia, MO, which has been facilitated primarily by having people over for dinner or being invited over. One couple has been particularly generous in opening up their home to us twice in one week: the first time just for dinner, the second to prepare and can 9 quarts of applesauce. After this latest visit, they also gifted us several vegetables from their garden, among which was a humongous zucchini. Challenged by how to prepare such a large squash, we turned to pie. Unfortunately, zucchini pie is not some unknown but secretly delicious relic of Southern culture. There are few recipes available and the recipe we chose is quiche-like, which ultimately resulted in something of a pie-shaped casserole.</p>

			<p>This pie is rated a 3 in difficulty because of the work it took to prepare the zucchini. I shredded the entire zucchini in two rounds, acquiring 3 cups for the pie and 3 for pumpkin zucchini bread (which is good and highly recommended). Zucchinis are incredibly moist and this one had huge seeds, making them rather messy to shred. I had to remove the seeds manually after a few shreds on the box grater. The zucchini shreds were soaked in salt to draw out their moisture before I squeezed them in a clean towel to remove the rest of the juice. I was left with a moist clump of compressed shreds.</p>

			<p>Preparing the rest of the filling was straightforward. I sliced an onion as well as garlic (the latter was an artistic addition; I thought it would better the pie), which were included raw in the filling. To this was added eggs, butter, flour, seasonings, and copious amounts of shredded parmesan and white cheddar. I decided this pie was not worth making a crust, so I simply sprayed the pie dish with cooking spray and dumped the filling in. After it had baked for 30 minutes, I removed the pie to add more shredded cheese to make it look nice and golden on top.</p>

			<p>As I have already revealed, I did not like this pie. The only part of this pie that had good vibes was the melted cheese on the top. The taste of the pie was also mediocre. Despite my addition of garlic, it still lacked a defining flavor. The onions were still crunchy, the texture was unpleasant, and the egg flavor was not attractive. If it weren’t for Ben’s self-sacrificial resolve to eat this pie, I would have gotten rid of it already. To balance this review, here are Ben’s thoughts on the pie.</p>

			<p><i>It’s ok. I don’t quiche in general but the amount of parm on this one makes it edible. I will finish the last slices before the week is out rather than throw it away.</i></p>
