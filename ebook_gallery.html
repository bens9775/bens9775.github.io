		<h2><i>The Tale of Julie Browntail</i> Painting Gallery</h2>
		<p><a href="documents/TheTaleofJulieBrowntail.pdf">Here's the full ebook if you just want to see that.</a> Click <a href="ebook.html">here</a> to go back to the main page about this picture book.</p>

		  <img src="images/endo/0_cover.png" alt="Squirrel on branch." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 1. </b>The front cover. I painting this one about a year ago. That was when I found my interest in painting squirrels. Without this painting, I would not have made this book at all. For that reason,
			 I have placed it on the book's cover.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/1_at_desk.png" alt="Squirrel at a school desk." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 2. </b>I tried to have her leaning with her head on her paws but it didn't come out quite right.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/2_falling.png" alt="Old squirrel falling from branch." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 3. </b>This was the first one I made specifically for the book and I realized I had spent too much time on it. I lowered the level of detail for all the others.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/3_leap.png" alt="Squirrel leaping between trees." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 4. </b>Julie's brother is not going to make the leap.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/4_vitruvian.png" alt="Squirrel teaching anatomy." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 5. </b>Miss Rufa is teaching anatomy from a diagram inspired by Da Vinci's <a href'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man'>Vitruvian Man.</a></p>

			<img src="images/endo/5_bone.png" alt="Painting of a bone." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 6. </b>I did not describe the marrow and cartilage in the text, but it didn't hurt to include them. Most children have probably at least heard them mentioned.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/6_recess.png" alt="Two squirrels talking." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 7. </b>Out the window is a tire swing hanging from a branch with a young squirrel in it.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/7_microscope.png" alt="Microscrope." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 8. </b>Based on some old microscopes I saw in a stockroom at my university.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/8_cell.png" alt="Diagram of a cell." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 9. </b>The lines around the cell are the collagen fibers that osteoblasts secrete into the bone matrix.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/9_paws.png" alt="A red squirrel paw above a brown one." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 10. </b>The colors aren't as different on a screen as they seemed on the paper.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/12_letter.png" alt="A letter entering a cell." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 11. </b>The letter represents a molecule of testosterone, which can cross the plasma membrane because it is nonpolar.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/10_weights.png" alt="A squirrel lifting a barbell." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 12. </b>I love this one so much. He's supposed to be wearing a sweatband.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/11_beaver1.png" alt="A beaver with a cell body." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 13. </b>Cellular beaver was a lot of fun to draw.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/13_birthday.png" alt="A beaver with a birthday party hat." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 14. </b>This is my favorite painting. He is wearing a birthday party hat because testosterone is causing him to live longer.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/14_hammock.png" alt="A beaver in a hammock." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 15. </b>Cellular beaver is taking some hard-earned rest on a beach.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/15_bed.png" alt="Old squirrel in bed." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 16. </b>I think the closed eye turned out well. The glasses felt necessary because they are part of Grandpa Browntail's visual identity.</p>

			<img src="images/endo/16_gift.png" alt="A squirrel giving another squirrel a pinecone." width="558" border="0" align="middle">
			<p><b>No. 17. </b>I thought bringing the story back around to the pinecone was a nice touch.</p>
